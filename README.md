## Function    
**LittleLink Custom provides** you with **a website similar to** [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/). Many **social media platforms only allow you to add one link**, with this you can simply **link to your LittleLink Custom page** and have **all the links you want** displayed on one site. You can share all your links to your social media platform or important links to **easy accessible and hosted on your own web-server** or web-hosting provider. On this website, other users can register and create their own links, you can access other user via the Admin Panel.


<br>
	    
## About
**LittleLink Custom** is a fork of [LittleLink Admin](https://github.com/latuminggi/littlelink-admin) with a **set goal** of making the admin panel **easier to use and setup**, for inexperienced and first-time user's, with the addition of **many custom features** themed around customization for the individual users, LittleLink pages.

**LittleLink Custom** was made for the purpose of making LittleLink as well as LittleLink Admin **easier to use and setup**, by people who have never coded before nor have extensive web hosting knowledge. This project is set up in a way that you can **just drag and drop** the LittleLink Custom **directory onto** your web host's **root directory** without ever having to touch the source code or deal with pesky terminal commands.

In addition to an easier setup process, this fork adds **many custom features** for an improved and more feature rich user experience. All UI pages feature a **dark mode**, which automatically applies if your operating system's or browser theme is set to dark. LittleLink Custom adds light unobtrusive **CSS animations** for an esthetically pleasing **responsive design**. Many small changes like this have been implemented that add up to a substantial feature set that **sets LittleLink Custom apart from other forks**.

## Installation

### Downloading and installing steps:
* **[Download](https://github.com/JulianPrieber/littlelink-custom/releases)** the latest release of LittleLink Custom and simply place the folder 'littlelink-custom' in the root directory of your website.

### That's it! No coding no command line setup just plug and play.

<br>	

#### Now access your install of LittleLink Custom with 'your-domain-name.com/littlelink-custom'.
* At first, you will be greeted with a 'MissingAppKeyException'.
* This is totally normal on first setups, simply click on the 'Generate app key' button and then 'Refresh now' and you're done.

#### You can now log in to the Admin Panel with the credentials:
-   **email:** `admin@admin.com`
-   **password:** `12345678`


### Optional configuration:
Optionally, you can change the app name in your ".env" file in the root directory of your LittleLink Custom installation. At the moment this is set to
APP_NAME="LittleLink Custom" you can change "LittleLink Custom" to what ever you like. This setting defines the page title and welcome message.

Additionally, the littlelink-custom directory can be renamed to anything you see fit, further customizing your personal LittleLink Custom install.

<br>

## Updating

When a **new version** is released, you will get an update notification on your Admin Panel.

### Disclaimer: Always make a backup  before updating in case something breaks!

To update, simply download the 'update' file from [here](https://github.com/JulianPrieber/littlelink-custom/releases). Do not use the regular release for the update, as it contains files that will overwrite important files that store your links and user information, effectively resetting your installation.

The downloaded archive contains a 'README' which tells you exactly how to update.

In most cases, you will just have to move the contents of the update file into your LittleLink Custom directory. It is essential to overwrite existing files for the updates to apply.
